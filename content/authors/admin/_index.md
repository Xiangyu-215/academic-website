I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate in {{< staticref "https://cs.uiowa.edu/informatics" "newtab" >}}Information Science{{< /staticref >}} at the University of Iowa, under the supervision of {{< staticref "https://tippie.uiowa.edu/people/kang-zhao" "newtab" >}}Dr. Kang Zhao{{< /staticref >}}. I am on the 2021/2022 academic job market.

My research focuses on data analytics for social media. My current research not only analyzes usersâ€™ online behaviors in various types of social media, but also attempts to connect their online and offline behaviors. I cover both special-purpose social media (e.g., online health communities) as well as general-purpose social media (e.g., Twitter).
