I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate in Information Science at the University of Iowa. My research focuses on data analytics for social media. I have applied text mining, regression models and machine learning to address real-world analytics problems. My current research not only analyzes users’ online behaviors in various types of social media, but also attempts to connect their online and offline behaviors. I cover both special-purpose social media (e.g., online health communities) as well as general-purpose social media (e.g., Twitter).
