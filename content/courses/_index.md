- The TA was one of the best I've had at Tippie.
- The instructor was kind and knew the material!
- I think you did a great job teaching this course. All concepts were explained well, you were always patient with students trying to catch up, and you were always willing to help students which was appreciated.

- The way that she walked us through the labs was very helpful.
