**Student Comments**
- I think that Ms. Wang is a wonderful person and instructor. Thank you for an awesome semester and I hope you have a great rest of your school year!
- The TA was one of the best I've had at Tippie.
- The instructor was kind and knew the material!
- I think you did a great job teaching this course. All concepts were explained well, you were always patient with students trying to catch up, and you were always willing to help students which was appreciated.
- The step by step instruction in this lab made the course easy to follow, and it made complicated concepts easy to understand. Xiangyu always asked the class if her pace was appropriate and was more than happy to show a concept again if anyone was struggling.
- I had a great experience in her classes
- The way that she walked us through the labs was very helpful.
- Thank you for all of your help and for answering any questions I had!
- Thanks for taking the time to respond to all my emails and answering my questions after class.
- You were great!
- Teacher was very eager to help
- you are awesome
- You are the reason I am passing this class (for now), so thanks for that.
